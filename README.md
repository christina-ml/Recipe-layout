This week: Recipe Layout

Ready for your next CodePen Challenge?

This monthâ€™s theme is layouts! A good page layout is not only great to look at, but it makes the content of the page easier to use, read, or understand.

Each week in June weâ€™ll give you a page full of unstyled HTML, and leave it up to you to give it an interesting layout. This is a great month to flex your flexbox skills, level up your grids, or show off your art direction chops.

Letâ€™s get this layouts challenge cooking with a recipe! This week, weâ€™ve cooked up a quick pasta recipe for you to garnish with a great layout. Thereâ€™s a lot of tasty little morsels in the HTML to sink you teeth into. Weâ€™ve got a couple of images, headings, and paragraphs, plus a sneaky little unordered list tucked into an ordered list.

Feel free to add classes or attributes to the HTML elements and move elements around if you like, but challenge yourself to use them all!
